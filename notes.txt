## created project structure, init git repository
   Setup project structure and started version control

## created Makefile
   Really just a place holder for now. Compiling everything manually with a
   clang command alias.

## readline
   Writing a readline function. Appears to be working and adding line numbers
   as needed for a listing file, but fgets() doesn't seem to grab all 72
   characters from a line unless I give it a buffer of size 79. Been a while
   since I've done anything in C, so I'm going to have to read some docs. I
   wonder if this is even critical given the line length restriction.

## More adventures with Makefile and project structure

   Spent a few hours wrestling with headers and the Makefile so that I can 
   HOPEFULLY keep this somewhat organized as it grows. I think I'm just about
   ready to start writing the "machines" for this and creating a reserved word
   file.

   This will likely change a lot but the current structure looks like this:
   .
   ├── bin
   ├── data
   │   └── example.pas
   ├── Makefile
   ├── notes.txt
   ├── obj
   └── src
       ├── headers
       │   └── relops.h
       ├── lex
       │   ├── identifier.c
       │   ├── int.c
       │   ├── longreal.c
       │   ├── real.c
       │   ├── relops.c
       │   ├── reserved.c
       │   └── ws.c
       └── readline.c
